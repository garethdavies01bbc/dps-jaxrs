Upgrade work to enable DPUB-993 to work with Spring 4.3.20.RELEASE

* These notes are in progress.

The basic idea for this work is to remove the old dependency cxf-bundle-jaxrs and migrate to CXF 3.* +

So far these classes have been migrated along with the accompanying tests:

HttpRequestMonitor  - now uses ContainerRequestContext and ContainerResponseContext.
HttpResponseMonitor - now uses ContainerRequestFilter.
MemcacheStatusFilter - now uses ContaineRequest/ResponseFilter and ContainerRequest/ResponseContext.
Caching500ErrorsForARevalidationPreventer - now uses ContainerRequest/ResponseFilter & ContainerRequest/ResponseContext
AbstractHttpRequestCertificateAuth - now uses ContainerRequestFilter.
AuditLogger - now uses ContainerRequestFilter & ContainerRequestContext.
HappyMetricFilter - now uses ContainerResponseFilter & ContainerResponseContext.
HttpResponseVersionProvider - now uses ContainerRequestContext & ContainerResponseContext.

Classes still to migrate:

- CustomWADLGenerator
- HttpRequestProductionGatewayCertificateAuth

There is a new dependency cxf-rt-frontend-jaxrs 3.2.0 which handles the Monitor classes mentions above.

The plan I am following is basically:

- Commenting out the cxf 2 bundle  dependency in pom.xml and then seeing what breaks
in compile and test.
- Looking up the migration notes and replacing the existing functionality with the recommended
migration to cxf 3.
- Then running tests again...seeing if I can remove cxf-bundle 2 again...etc...until finally we can remove cxf-bundle 2 without
any problems.

I think the next parts to be replaced will be the classes involving WADL. If I remove cxf-bundle these start flagging up
when running tests. The cxf 3 dependency I added may not cover all the functionality here (it may do - I have no idea!)
so you may have to hunt about for another cxf maven dependency. Lots of useful stuff on Stack Overflow and below.

For mocking out the Intercepter I added and used Powermock.
